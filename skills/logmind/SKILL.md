  MUST be loaded for any task in a project that uses logmind (detect by:
  .logmind/config.yml at repo root, or AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md mentioning
  logmind, or docs/decisions.md present). Use BEFORE writing >20 lines of
  new code, BEFORE choosing between alternatives, BEFORE adding a
  dependency, BEFORE modifying existing functionality, BEFORE making any
  security or performance trade-off, BEFORE renaming or moving any
  significant module. Logging is part of the work, not after it. Also use
  to read prior decisions before starting any task in such a project so
  you don't re-litigate something already decided.

# logmind: log decisions as you work

If the current project contains `.logmind/config.yml` or its `AGENTS.md`
mentions logmind, this skill applies. Log a decision **before** writing
non-trivial code, not after.

## When to log

Log a decision whenever you:

- Make an architectural or design choice
- Choose between alternative approaches
- Write significant new code (> 20 lines or a new module)
- Modify existing functionality in a non-obvious way
- Add or remove a dependency
- Make a security or performance decision

When in doubt, log it. A short decision entry is cheap; recovering missing
context months later is not.

## How to log

### Python

```python
from logmind import log

log("Use PostgreSQL for primary database",
    reasoning="Need ACID compliance and complex joins",
    alternatives=["MongoDB", "SQLite"],
    implications=["Connection pooling required", "Schema migrations needed"])
```

### CLI

```bash
logmind log "Use PostgreSQL for primary database" \
  -r "Need ACID compliance and complex joins" \
  -a "MongoDB" -a "SQLite" \
  -i "Connection pooling required" \
  -i "Schema migrations needed"
```

## Branch-aware logging

When you are on a feature branch (anything other than the project's default
branch), the entry is written to
`docs/decisions-branches/<sanitized-branch>.md` rather than
`docs/decisions.md`. On PR merge, a GitHub Action appends a one-line
summary linking the PR + the per-branch file to `docs/decisions.md`. You do
not need to manage this routing — `logmind log` does it automatically.

## Reading prior context

Before starting non-trivial work, read:

- `docs/decisions.md` — 20 most recent decisions on the default branch
- `docs/decisions-branches/<your-branch>.md` (if present) — decisions made
  earlier on the same feature branch
- `docs/file-structure.md` — current project tree

```bash
logmind show               # recent decisions on the current branch
logmind show --all         # include archive
logmind search "postgres"  # full-text across both files
```

## Setup (one-time, per project)

If the project doesn't yet have logmind:

```bash
pip install logmind
logmind init               # scaffolds docs/, AGENTS.md, GH Actions, .gitignore block
```

## Don'ts

- **Don't use `git add` + `git commit` directly** for changes that carry a
  decision. `logmind log` writes the decision file, stages every change in
  the working tree, and creates the commit in one step. Manual `git commit`
  bypasses the logging entirely or splits it across two commits — both lose
  the value of reasoning attached to the code.
- Don't log every tiny edit. The 20-line rule is a guideline; use judgement.
- Don't write the decision after the fact in past tense for trivial code.
- Don't reword a decision someone else already logged — link or extend it.
- Don't bypass the auto-commit (`--no-commit`) unless you know the project's
  branch protection requires it.
